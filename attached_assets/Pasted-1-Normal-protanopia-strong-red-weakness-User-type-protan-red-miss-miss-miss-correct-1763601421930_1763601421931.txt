1. Normal protanopia (strong red weakness)

User type: protan

red:   ["miss","miss","miss","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ protan severity = 0.45
→ type: protan

2. Normal deutan (green weakness)

User type: deutan

red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["miss","miss","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ deutan severity = 0.25
→ type: deutan

3. Normal tritan (blue weakness)

User type: tritan

red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["miss","miss","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ tritan severity = 0.25
→ type: tritan

4. User does not know type (protan highest)

User type: undefined

red:   ["miss","miss","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ protan = 0.25

5. User does not know type (tritan highest)
red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["miss","miss","miss","correct","correct","correct"]


→ tritan = 0.45
→ type: tritan

⚠️ 6. Conflict: user says protan, test says deutan

User type: protan

red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["miss","miss","miss","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ protan = 0.00
→ deutan = 0.45
→ expected = protan (user override)

⚠️ 7. Conflict: user says deutan, test says tritan

User type: deutan

red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["miss","miss","miss","correct","correct","correct"]


→ deutan = 0.00

→ expected = deutan

⚠️ 8. Conflict: user says tritan, test says protan

User type: tritan

red:   ["miss","miss","miss","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ protan = 0.45

→ expected = tritan

😵‍💫 9. User says protan, test says normal
red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ all severities = 0
→ expected = protan (user override)

😵‍💫 10. User says deutan, test normal

→ same responses
→ expected = deutan

😵‍💫 11. User says tritan, test normal

→ same responses
→ expected = tritan

🌓 12. Mixed protan/deutan
red:   ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ protan = 0.10
→ deutan = 0.10
→ highest = protan
→ type: protan

🌓 13. Mixed deutan/tritan
red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ both ~0.10 → pick first highest (deutan)
→ type: deutan

🌓 14. Mixed protan/tritan
red:   ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ protan = 0.10
→ tritan = 0.10
→ pick protan
→ type: protan

🟡 15. All near-normal
red:   ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ all 0
→ pick protan
→ type: protan (or "normal" depending on your design)

🟡 16. All extremely close
red:   ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
green: ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]


→ all = 0.10

→ type: protan

17. Strong protan, moderate deutan
red:   ["miss","miss","miss","miss","correct","correct"]
green: ["miss","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
blue:  ["correct","correct","correct","correct","correct","correct"]
